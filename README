Welcome, to menv: a specialized script to setup a computer environment just the
way I like it. With a single remote execution of a bash script menv will install
itself. You can do this with:

  source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install)

On a mac you may need to:
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install > /tmp/mi ; source /tmp/mi

This script will setup dotfiles and so much more.

Sometimes I have private aliases for work or that just run on a single box. For
these you can edit the files:
  ~/menv/local/menv_local_login
and
  ~/menv/local/menv_local_nonlogin
These will be sourced in the correct location (bashrc, bash_profile, etc).

The local folder is where all the users data is stored. The backup folder is
where various menv utilities store things that they don't think should be
deleted. The local and backup dirs are treated as sacred and should always be
preserved even when menv is uninstalled. In this way the user controls the
contents of the local dir and the backup dir is auto generated but the user
still has the final say on whether or not to delete them.
