Welcome, to menv: a specialized script to setup a computer environment just the
way I like it. With a single remote execution of a bash script menv will install
itself. You can do this with:

  source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install)

The base of this system are a set of targets that are executed at certain
points.

There are the menv life cycle targets of install, uninstall, and update. The
install target is further broken into global and user installs. On install the
system will ask a few questions including if the user has root access, if the
user wishes to install standard menv packages, and whether or not the system is
being used as a desktop system. Root access requiring target scripts go under
install_global.d while ones which don't require root go under install_user.d.
Additionally scripts can have a require line which makes it so they are executed
in certain environments. Scripts should also not use curl, wget, git clone, etc
(anything accessing the internet) as the core/lib provides functions to do this
which are proxy aware.

There are also the tty life cycle targets of login, nonlogin, and logout. These
also can have requirement lines.

The vault folder is where all the users data is stored and it is treated as
sacred and should always be preserved even when menv is uninstalled.

Sometimes I have private aliases, etc for work. For these I have the files:
  ~/menv/vault/login
and
  ~/menv/vault/nonlogin
which are executed in the appropriate target.
