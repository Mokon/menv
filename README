Welcome, to menv: a specialized script to setup a computer environment just the
way I like it. With a single remote execution of a bash script menv will install
itself. You can do this with:

  source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install)

On a mac you may need to:
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install > /tmp/mi ; source /tmp/mi

This script will setup dotfiles and so much more: installing menv.

From then on to update the script call:
  menv_update
If you have internet connectivity whenever you login the menv script will
update automatically.

To uninstall the script call:
  menv_uninstall

Sometimes I have private aliases for work or that just run on a single box. For
these you can edit the files:
  ~/menv/local/menv_local_login
and
  ~/menv/local/menv_local_nonlogin
These will be sourced in the correct location (bashrc or bash_profile).

menv tries to be a good citizen, backing up files not belonging to it and
giving you a good way to uninstall it.

The local folder is where all the users data is stored. The backup folder is
where various menv utilities store things that they don't think should be
deleted. The local and backup dirs are treated as sacred and should always be
preserved even when menv is uninstalled. In this way the user controls the
contents of the local dir and the backup dir is auto generated but the user
still has the final say on whether or not to delete them.

The cache dir contains various temporary files that are safe to delete. The
core, targets, pkgs, and dotfiles contains what really makes menv. pkgs are
portions of code that are designed such that they don't rely on menv as a whole.
The dotfiles are exzactly what the folder sounds like. Normally these are sym
linked in the correct program location.

The trash is of course a trash directory. The bin dir is for user local compiled
and installed programs.
