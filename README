Welcome, to menv: a specialized script to setup a computer environment just the
way I like it. With a single remote execution of a bash script menv will install
itself. You can do this with:

  source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install)

On certain systems you may need to:
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mokon/menv/master/core/remote_install > /tmp/mi ; source /tmp/mi

The vault folder is where all the users data is stored and it is treated as
sacred and should always be preserved even when menv is uninstalled.

Sometimes I have private aliases, etc for work. For these I have the files:
  ~/menv/vault/login
and
  ~/menv/vault/nonlogin
